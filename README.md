This project involves creating HTML files of cooking recipes. Includes a homepage with links to the recipes, and three recipe pages. Each recipe page includes a title, description of the food, a picture of the food, a list of ingredients, and a list of cooking steps. Demonstrates usage of fundamental HTML concepts such as paragraphs, headings, links, images, and lists.
